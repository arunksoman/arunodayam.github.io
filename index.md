title: Welcome to Our Jekyll theme
MathJax: true
---

Hai... Friends, First of all I would like to say I am **not a webdesigner**. But you don't have to worry about that, while forking this Jekyll theme or template. This is one of the best theme available for Jekyll. I am using this theme for my personal blog. If you are like this theme, you can fork this theme. This theme is fully open source. **But you have to ensure that the contents in the blog({% raw %}_post folder{% endraw %}) is not publishing along with creating your blog.** It is a multipurpose Jekyll theme. But this theme is more suitable for blogging. This theme has following features:

* Post by category
* Posts are archived by tags
* Tag cloud
* Search using supersearch.js
* Intro Image for each post
* Parallax effect for each post
* Sitemap
* Two way syntax highlighting
* Syntax highlighting using Prism and Rouge
* More color options for theme(Powered with W3.css)
* Mathjax support
* Important notes can be highlighted
* Including youtube video responsively
* Including modal image responsively

## Disadvantages
* Search overlay color do not changes with page color
* Didn't added extra grid for large display(1200px).
