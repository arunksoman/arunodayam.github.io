A new operating system kernel was introduced by a Finnish student named **Linus Torvalds** in 1991 as a part of his personal project. This operating system kernal was named **Linux** and it was a free operating system kernel. The Linus Torvalds had want to name his invention **Freax**(It was a linguistical blend of words "freak", "free", and "X" as an allusion to Unix). So he stored the program files under the name "Freax". Torvalds had already considered the name "Linux". But he think that it is too egotistical. In order to facilitate development, the files were uploaded to the FTP server of FUNET in September 1991. Ari Lemmke at Helsinki University of Technology (HUT), who was one of the volunteer administrators for the FTP server at the time, did not think that "Freax" was a good name. So, he named the project "Linux" on the server without consulting Torvalds. Later, however, Torvalds consented to "**Linux**".

## What is Linux?
Linux is a freely distributed implementation of a **UNIXâˆ’like kernel**, the low level
core of an operating system. Because Linux takes the UNIX system as its inspiration, Linux and UNIX

programs are very similar. In fact, almost all programs written for UNIX can be compiled and run under
Linux. Also, many commercial applications sold for commercial versions of UNIX can run unchanged in
binary form on Linux systems. Linux was developed by Linus Torvalds at the University of Helsinki, with the
help of UNIX programmers from across the Internet. It began as a hobby inspired by Andy Tanenbaum's
Minix, a small UNIX system, but has grown to become a complete UNIX system in its own right. The Linux
kernel doesn't use code from AT&T or any other proprietary source.
